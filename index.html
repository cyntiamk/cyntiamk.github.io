  <h3>About myself...</h3>
  <p>I was born and raised in Brazil and have always being passionate about travel
	  and languagues. After finishing college, I decided to explore a little bit of the
	  world. Travelled to Spain to improve my Spanish, joined a work experience program in the U.K.
	  to broaden my horizons. Moved to Japan after that to learn Japanese, had to work 
	  as factory worker to be able to save the money to pay for shcool. After gaining some
	  knowledge of the language, was able to find a job at a travel agency using my 
	  languagues skills. 
	  Moved to the U.S. with my husband and took some time off to start our family.

  <h3>Me as a Data Analyst</h3>
  <p>Now that I have fufilled many of my personal dreams, it is time to focus on my dream
	  career. I have always being marvelled by the technology world but never had the 
	  chance to explore it in depth. Before starting the Bootcamp Certification in Data 
	  Analytics, I had no previous knowledge in any sort of coding. 
	  It was a big challenge to learn so many complex topics in only 6 months. But each week, I looked forward to
	  working on a new assigment. The pace of the bootcamp didn't allow enough time
	  to cover every aspect of the topics, so it was up to me to apply all I had learned 
	  in class and also learn whatever was not covered in class by myself. I put in hours and more hours
	  into the assigments and always managed to accomplish them before the deadlines with 
	  grades A/A+
	  All the time invested was never seen as a hurdle but done it with pleasure, the 
	  pleasure of learning new skills and accomplishing challenging tasks. And I realize
	  how this is only possible because of how much I enjoy being a data analyst, specially
	  the development portion of it. Being able to translate big date into simple to 
	  understand charts and tables.
