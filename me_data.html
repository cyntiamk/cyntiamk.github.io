				<p> Now that I have fufilled many of my personal dreams, it is time to focus on my dream
						career. I have always being marvelled by the technology world but never had the 
						chance to explore it in depth. Before starting the Bootcamp Certification in Data 
						Analytics, I had no previous knowledge in any sort of coding. 
						It was a big challenge to learn so many complex topics in only 6 months. But each week, I looked forward to
						working on a new assigment. The pace of the bootcamp didn't allow enough time
						to cover every aspect of the topics, so it was up to me to apply all I had learned 
						in class and also learn whatever was not covered in class by myself. I put in hours and more hours
						into the assigments and always managed to accomplish them before the deadlines with 
						grades A/A+
						All the time invested was never seen as a hurdle but done it with pleasure, the 
						pleasure of learning new skills and accomplishing challenging tasks. And I realize
						how this is only possible because of how much I enjoy being a data analyst, specially
						the development portion of it. Being able to translate big date into simple to 
							understand charts and tables.
