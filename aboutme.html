    <h3>About myself...</h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Brazil and have always being passionate about travel
	  and languagues. After finishing college, I decided to explore a little bit of the
	  world. Travelled to Spain to improve my Spanish, joined a work experience program in the U.K.
	  to broaden my horizons. Moved to Japan after that to learn Japanese, had to work 
	  as factory worker to be able to save the money to pay for shcool. After gaining some
	  knowledge of the language, was able to find a job at a travel agency using my 
	  languagues skills. 
	  Moved to the U.S. with my husband and took some time off to start our family.
